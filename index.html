Omid Nohadani leads the Data Science team at Benefits Science, developing optimization and machine learning solutions for managing and structuring risk in health plans.
He is a professor at Northwestern University (and previously at Purdue), focusing on data-driven algorithms.
He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Southern California.
Dr. Nohadani was a postdoctoral researcher at the Operations Research Center at MIT and a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.
<!-- He specializes in algorithms and solutions
 for big-data environments affected by uncertainty and subjected to complex risk
 measures.  He has co-authored more than 45 scientific papers and -->
He received several research awards, including the best paper award for IISE Transactions on Healthcare
Systems Engineering (2018) and the best regional paper award of the American Association
for Physicists in Medicine (2013).
<!-- Currently, he is also an associate editor of IISE
Transactions and serves on the editorial board of INFORMS Service Sciences. -->

Nohadani's research is at the intersection of optimization and machine learning to control risk in complex systems under uncertainty, with applications in healthcare, supply chain management, analytics, and technology. In particular, he studies dynamic and data-driven systems with decision makers who face complex risk requirements. These integrated decision environments often require computationally challenging solutions. Methodologically, his research is on robust optimization which is capable of improving performance by accounting for uncertainties. <!--This is important because uncertainty is a natural phenomenon, and RO is widely applicable owing to how its set-based modeling of uncertainties makes it computationally tractable.
Of particular interest are environments of large data sizes and increasing intricacy of risk requirements that demand more versatile and efficient algorithms that accommodate richer characterizations of uncertainty.
These challenges often require a transdisciplinary approach, and my background in theoretical physics and mathematical optimization equips me well for this endeavor. -->
His methodological work is motivated by uncovering parallels between different applications and bridging seemingly disjoint disciplines, <!--(e.g., self-insured companies and computer vision or supply chains and proton therapy). <!--For this, I team with practitioners to facilitate practical solutions for future challenges. -->
with a proven record of leveraging these abstract approaches for solving real-world problems.
A number of his results are already implemented in medical and industrial applications.
