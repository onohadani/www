        <div style="display:none" id="rob_pred"><b>Summary:</b>
            Spatiotemporal tumor changes reduce the effectiveness of fractionated radiation therapy. We study a robust predictive method that can support treatment planning when spatiotemporal changes occur with uncertain progression
            A multi-scenario multi-time method is developed that hedges amongst these scenarios and provides plans that are on average equally good to current practice and remain acceptable even in the worst case. Two clinical lung cancer cases serve as proof of concept.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: Experts’ knowledge is directly incorporated into adaptive planning in a robust fashion, i.e., diverging opinions are accounted for.<br>
            2) Method: Offers a unifying framework for conventional, adaptive, and robust adaptive planning.<br>
            3) Application: The incorporation of multiple time-resolved datasets shows significantly improved treatment goals for patients with spatiotemporal changes during radiotherapy.<br>
            4) Application: The progress of chemotherapy can be accounted for into the radiation planning process, resulting plans withstands uncertainties, even in worst-case scenarios.

     <i>Robust Multi-Objective Clustering,</i>
     submitted (2016).<sup><b>*</b></sup>INFORMS Undergraduate Research Award 2015, 2nd place.
     <br>&#62;
     <a onclick="toggle_visibility('rmoc');"><u>Details</u></a>
     <div style="display:none" id="rmoc"><b>Summary:</b>
         A multi-objective method is proposed that leverages robust optimization for hierarchical clustering (rMOC). rMOC chooses clusters based on a weighted sum of data-intrinsic objective functions, determining a threshold that is most robust to uncertainties in these weights. We compare this method to K-means and Gaussian mixture models. In terms of misassignment rate, rMOC outperforms both other methods on several benchmark datasets.
         <br><br>
         <b>Contributions:</b>
         
         1) Method: Both reference methods require solving an NP-hard problem.
         In contrast, rMOC exhibits <i>O(m f(n))</i> complexity for data size <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> candidate thresholds, and user-supplied objective functions with complexity <i>f(n)</i>.<br>
         2) Method: rMOC can process data sequentially, reducing memory usage to a constant.<br>
         3) Application: rMOC is used on data from nanoHUB, a nanotechnology research web platform. Two new categories are consistently identified, offering insights into actual user behavior.<br>
        4) Application: This unsupervised learning method is generic, independent of data structure, and scales well, hence is suitable for a large variety of applications and can be enhanced by modular application of dimensionality reduction.

    <div style="display:none" id="qnet"><b>Abstract:</b>
        We introduce a new class of adaptive policies called <i>periodic-affine policies</i>, that allows a decision maker to optimally manage and control large-scale newsvendor networks in the presence of uncertain demand without distributional assumptions.
        These policies are data-driven and model many features of the demand such as correlation, and remain robust to parameter mis-specification.
        We present a model that can be generalized to multi-product settings and extended to multi-period problems.
        This is accomplished by modeling the uncertain demand via sets.
        In this way, it offers a natural framework to study competing policies such as base-stock, affine, and approximative approaches with respect to their profit, sensitivity to parameters and assumptions, and computational scalability.
        We show that the periodic-affine policies are sustainable, i.e. time consistent, because they warrant optimality both within subperiods and over the entire planning horizon.
        This approach is tractable and free of distributional assumptions, and hence, suited for real-world applications.
        We provide efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal periodic-affine policies and demonstrate their advantages on the sales data from one of India's largest pharmacy retailers.

    <div style="display:none" id="rmle"><b>Abstract:</b>
        In many applications, statistical estimators serve to derive conclusions from data, for example in finance, medical decision-making and clinical trials.
        However, the conclusions are typically dependent on uncertainties in the data.
        We use robust optimization principles to provide robust
        maximum likelihood estimators that are protected against data errors.
        Both types of input data errors are considered: a) adversarial type, modeled using the notion of uncertainty sets,
        and b) probabilistic type, modeled by distributions.
        We provide efficient local and global search algorithms to compute the robust estimators and discuss them in detail for the case of multivariate normally distributed data.
        The estimator performance is demonstrated on two applications.
        First, using computer simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed estimators are robust against both types of data uncertainty and provide more accurate estimates, compared to classical estimators which degrade significantly, when errors are encountered.
        We establish a range of uncertainty sizes, for which robust estimators are superior.
        Second, we analyze deviations in cancer radiation therapy planning.
        Uncertainties amongst plans are caused by patients' individual anatomies
        and the trial-and-error nature of the process.
        When analyzing a large set of past clinical treatment data,
        robust estimators offer more reliable decisions when applied to a large set of past treatment plans.

        The efficacy of robust optimization spans a variety of settings with uncertainties bounded in predetermined sets.
        In many applications, uncertainties are affected by decisions and cannot be modeled with current frameworks.
        This paper takes a step towards generalizing robust linear optimization to problems with decision-dependent uncertainties.
        In general settings, we show these problems to be NP-complete.
        To alleviate the computational inefficiencies, we introduce a class of uncertainty sets whose size depends on binary decisions.
        We propose reformulations that improve upon alternative standard linearization techniques.
        To illustrate the advantages of this framework, a shortest path problem is discussed, where the uncertain arc lengths are affected by decisions.
        Beyond the modeling and performance advantages, the proposed notion of proactive uncertainty control also mitigates over conservatism of current robust optimization approaches.

        Motion and uncertainty in radiotherapy is traditionally handled via margins. The clinical target volume (CTV) is expanded to a larger planning target volume (PTV), which is irradiated to the prescribed dose. However, the PTV concept has several limitations, especially in proton therapy. Therefore, robust and probabilistic optimization methods have been developed that directly incorporate motion and uncertainty into treatment plan optimization for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Thereby, the explicit definition of a PTV becomes obsolete and treatment plan optimization is directly based on the CTV. Initial work focused on random and systematic setup errors in IMRT. Later, inter-fraction prostate motion and intra-fraction lung motion became a research focus. Over the past 10 years, IMPT has emerged as a new application for robust planning methods. In proton therapy, range or setup errors may lead to dose degradation and misalignment of dose contributions from different beams ‚Äì a problem that cannot generally be addressed by margins. Therefore, IMPT has led to the first implementations of robust planning methods in commercial planning systems, making these methods available for clinical use. This paper first summarizes the limitations of the PTV concept. Subsequently, robust optimization methods are introduced and their applications in IMRT and IMPT planning are reviewed.

        Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric, data driven method to conduct relative performance measurements among a set of decision making units (DMUs). Efficiency scores are computed based on assessing input and output data for each DMU by means of linear programming. Traditionally, these data are assumed to be known precisely. We instead consider the situation in which data is uncertain, and in this case, we demonstrate that efficiency scores increase monotonically with uncertainty. This enables inefficient DMUs to leverage uncertainty to counter their assessment of being inefficient.
        <br><br>
        Using the framework of robust optimization, we propose an uncertain DEA (uDEA) model for which an optimal solution determines 1) the maximum pos- sible efficiency score of a DMU over all permissible uncertainties, and 2) the minimal amount of uncertainty that is required to achieve this efficiency score. We show that the uDEA model is a proper generalization of traditional DEA and provide a first-order algorithm to solve the uDEA model with ellipsoidal un- certainty sets. Finally, we present a case study applying uDEA to the problem of deciding efficiency of radiotherapy treatments.

    <div style="display:none" id="time_dep"><b>Abstract:</b>
        In the recent past, robust optimization methods have been developed and successfully applied to a variety of single-stage problems. More recently, some of these approaches have been extended to multi-stage settings with fixed uncertainties. However, in many real-world applications, uncertainties evolve over time, rendering the robust solutions suboptimal. This issue is particularly prevalent in medical decision making, where a patient’s condition can change during the course of the treatment. In the context of radiation therapy, changes in cell oxygenation directly affect the response to radiation. To address such uncertain changes, we provide a general robust optimization framework that incorporates time-dependent uncertainty sets in a tractable fashion. Temporal changes reside within a cone, whose projection at each step yields the current uncertainty set. We develop conic robust two-stage linear problems and provide their robust counterparts for uncertain constraint parameters, covering the range of radiation therapy problems. For a clinical prostate cancer case, the time-dependent robust approach improves the tumor control throughout the treatment, as opposed to current methods that lose efficacy at some stage. We show that this advantage does not bear additional risks compared to current clinical methods. For intermediate diagnostics, we provide the optimal observation timing that maximizes the value of information. While these findings are relevant to clinical settings, they are also general and can be applied to a broad range of applications; e.g., in maintenance scheduling.

        <div style="display:none" id="bao"><b>Summary:</b> In radiation therapy planning, there are two key decisions: selection of beam angles and optimal beam intensities.
            Often, these two decisions are made separately, even though they are mutually dependent.
            We develop an algorithm which automatically selects the beam angles and computes the beam intensities. Since the size of this problem is computationally intractable for clinical cases, we propose a hybrid method, which combines a simulated annealing procedure of Bertsimas and Nohadani (2010) with the knowledge of the gradient. Gradient information is used to quickly find a local minimum, while simulated annealing allows to search for global minima.
            The beam intensities are optimized by solving a Linear Programming model.
            Experimental results are performed on phantom and real-life case studies, showing the advantages that come from our approach.

            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: Previous approaches are computationally not tractable, while this method performs for clinical cases in practical times.<br>
            2) Application: While the clinical practice relies on expert’s decision on “good’’ beam angle, this method offers optimal solutions.<br>
            3) Application: Previous work required a set of candidate angles, whereas this method optimized over the entire range. Indeed, it dynamically explores angles and discretizes to the maximum accuracy of the linear accelerator machine.<br>

        Motion uncertainties can significantly degrade an otherwise optimized treatment plan, particularly for lung cases.
        We present a spatiotemporal optimization method, which takes into account all phases of breathing and provides a 4D-optimal plan. Monte Carlo dose calculations are employed for highest dosimetric accuracy.
        We demonstrate the performance with clinical lung cancer cases and compare the outcomes to conventional gating techniques.

        Although the theory of robust convex optimization has taken significant strides over the past decade, all approaches fail if the underlying cost function is not explicitly given; it is even worse if the cost function is nonconvex. In this work, we present a robust optimization method for unconstrained problems with a nonconvex cost function as well as for problems based on simulations, such as large partial differential equations solver, response surface, and Kriging metamodels. This technique can be employed for most real-world problems.

        <b>Contributions:</b>
        1) Method: This is the first nonconvex robust optimization approach, which has been applied to many real-world problems by us and many others.<br>
        2) Method: The generalization addresses nonconvex optimization problems under both implementation errors and parameter uncertainties.<br>
        3) Application: In an electromagnetic multiple scattering problem of aperiodically arranged dielectrics, relevant to nanophotonic design, our robust solution significantly lowered the worst-case cost, while maintaining optimality.

        All radiation therapy planning relies on accurate dose calculation.
        A robust optimization method is introduced which handles dosimetric errors and warrants for high-quality IMRT plans. Unlike other dose error estimations, we do not rely on the detailed knowledge about the sources of the uncertainty and use a generic error model. We demonstrate the method on a clinical case of lung cancer.

        1) Method: The generic error models allows to cope with a large variety of error sources.<br>

        For the design of nanoscale dielectric structures for photonic applications,
        two complementary algorithms are introduced.
        The first approach uses adaptive local random updates and progressively adjusts individual dielectric layer widths.
        The second approach is based on global updating functions in which large subgroups of layers are adjusted simultaneously.
        Both schemes are applied to obtain specific target responses of the transmission function within selected energy windows.

        <b>Contributions:</b>
        1) Method: The local approach relies on an annealing process with constraints and is improved using Metropolis criterion.<br>
        2) Method: The global approach is based on an analytical expansion of the strength function, fixing the leading order expansion coefficients by boundary conditions, and adjusting the remaining ones by numerical optimization.<br>

    <div style="display:none" id="hyp" ><b>Abstract:</b><br>
        <i>Purpose:</i> To investigate the inclusion of hypoxia and reoxygenation information into IMRT planning. A robust planning framework is compared to current clinical practices for a prostate cancer case.<br>
         
        <i>Method:</i>  Hypoxia reduces radiosensitivity of cells. Current practice to overcome this limited efficacy of treatment includes dose escalations to hypoxic tumor subregions by modifying the prescribed dose by a scaling factor based on initial PET scans. This factor remains constant throughout the treatment. In order to leverage reoxygenation of hypoxic cells, we employ a time-dependent scaling factor. The changes in reoxygenation are driven by perfusion and angiogenesis and their progression is uncertainty. Therefore, we model the scaling factor to reside in a time-dependent uncertainty set. When mid-treatment PET scans are available, this set is updated to incorporate this observation. A robust optimization model with a time-dependent uncertainty set is solved for a finite set of clinically realistic scenarios.<br>
         
        <i>Results:</i> Weekly EUD are computed for all three plans: the robust plan shows and average improvement of 30% compared to the equal dose per fraction plan, which ignores hypoxia, and 4% compared to escalated plans, which neglects reoxygenation. For organ sparing, bladder and rectum D15 for the robust plan remains within 4% of the equal dose per fraction plan under nominal and worst-case conditions (deviating progression rate than assumed), whereas the escalated plan increases bladder D15 by 11% and rectum by 19%.<br>
         
        <i>Conclusions:</i>
        It is possible to leverage reoxygenation information in order to produce temporally uniform dose distributions, which is the objective of fractionation. The uncertain progression can be modeled via a robust framework that improves plans by reducing dose to critical organs without sacrificing target coverage.          <br><br>

    <div style="display:none" id="hyp" ><b>Abstract:</b><br>
        <i>Purpose:</i> To investigate the efficacy of maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) in IMRT plan analysis. Robust estimators are compared to standard MLE for a large cohort of cancer patients treated with IMRT.<br>
         
        <i>Method:</i>  Standard MLEs are known to be sensitive to sample choice and sample size. This renders the derived conclusions unreliable, despite their clinical popularity. Using robust optimization principles, we develop robust MLEs that are immune against uncertainties and remain reliable even in worst-case deviations. This method is well suited for large-scale and high-dimensional data. We compare them to standard MLEs on 491 delivered treatment plans based on their DVH points Dx. All treatments followed the same protocols and were planned with the same TPS. We simulate typical institutional analysis for means and covariances of Dx. An estimator is considered reliable, when its value remains stable for differing sample sets, i.e., when estimators exhibit a narrow spread over sampled data sets. We conduct two experiments: a) constant sample size but varying samples and b) for varying sample sizes.<br>
         
        <i>Results:</i> The spread of robust means are stable and the same as the standard sample means for input data deviations. With regard to sample-size dependence, sample means exhibit a sizable sensitivity, whereas the robust means remain unchanged. These results apply to all relevant Dx, making robust estimators superior over the clinically relevant range. These advantages are magnified for higher estimators, such as covariances and correlation coefficients which are key metrics for analyzing protocol adherence.<br>
         
        <i>Conclusions:</i>
            Robust estimators are immune against variations in sample and sample size, hence are suited to provide more reliable dosimetric plan analysis. Their computation is efficient for big data and independent of the error sources.

        <div style="display:none" id="hyp" ><b>Summary:</b>
            Uncertainties in oxygenation of tumor cells are incorporated into radiation therapy planning via robust optimization. Due to the unpredictable nature of re-oxygenation of hypoxic cells, the radio-sensitivity factor and its change is modeled to reside in a time-dependent uncertainty set. This uncertainty can adapt to both pre- and mid-treatment PET scans. The model is demonstrated using a clinical prostate cancer case.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: The original NP-hard problem is reformulated into a linear program with finitely many linear constraints, which can be solved efficiently.<br>
            2) Application: The method can improve tumor coverage by increasing dose to hypoxic tumor voxels that is overlooked by common fractionated treatments.<br>
            3) Application: Model anticipates the re-oxygenation process, thus reducing excess dose at later fractions in comparison to uniform dose-escalation methods.

            To guide the IMRT planning process, institutional and standardized recommendations are available.
            However, in practice one or more of the recommended aims cannot be satisfied.
            We analyze the set of common goals to identify potential issues in IMRT planning that inherently prevent goals to be concurrently satisfied.
            This study showed that some of the recommendations are in fact competing and, hence, cannot be met concurrently.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) 500 IMRT plans for various sites were analyzed based on the institutional DVH goal for PTV (D<sub>95</sub>) and the recommendations by ICRU-83 (D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>50</sub>, D<sub>98</sub>, and D<sub>100</sub>).<br>
            2) Variations amongst the DVH goals for PTV were independent of the tumor site.<br>
            3) Negative correlations were observed between D<sub>50</sub> and D<sub>98</sub> for PTV.<br>
            4) These results offer a framework to identify independent and effective planning goals that enhance plan quality and improve compliance.

        <div style="display:none" id="relax" ><b>Summary:</b>
            In IMRT, desired dose distributions are iteratively approached via inverse planning. This leads to tradeoffs between clinical objectives for the planning target volume, organs at risk, and normal tissues. We analyze common goals and identify potential reasons that often lead to tradeoffs.

            Correlation between dose-volume control points and treatment outcomes are analyzed.

The results inform the treatment planning process when competing dose-volume criteria requires relaxations.

            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) 32 patients, treated with whole-field sequential intensity modulated radiation therapy during 2009–2010 period, are considered for this study. Acute dysphagia that is categorized into 3 grades is observed on all patients. <br>
            2) For correlation with dysphagia, D<sub>min</sub> on cervico-thoracic esophagus is statistically significant. Also, D<sub>mean</sub> on cervico-thoracic esophagus is significant in association with dysphagia.<br>
            3) No correlation was observed between D<sub>max</sub> and dysphagia. For target complications, D<sub>50</sub> on the target is a statistically significant dose control point

        <div style="display:none" id="time_resolved" ><b>Summary:</b>
            We develop a stochastic time‐resolved model that accounts for spatiotemporal changes in tumor over the extended course of the treatment. We also aim to mitigate the effect of uncertainties, yet generate clinically acceptable plans even in worst‐case scenarios. The performance of the method is demonstrated based on a clinical lung cancer case.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) The underlying model unites three different different approaches: incorporating single CT, 4D-CT, and multiple-patient 4D-CTs, allowing for direct comparison.<br>
            2) Conventional models disregarding tumor regression lead to significant overdose on OAR as time progresses. The nominal time‐resolved model allows for redistribution of the dose based on tumor regression. When regression assumptions deviate from the realized, tumor coverage isclinically not acceptable. <br>
            3) The time‐resolved model mitigates the uncertain knowledge about tumor regression. It meets tumor dose criterion, whilst sparing the OAR even in the worst‐case scenario.

        <div style="display:none" id="andrew" ><b>Summary:</b>
            The process of IMRT planning is an iterative inverse process, hence creating a plethora of competing objectives.
            A key tool to inspect the quality of plans is the DVH. This inspection, however, is primarily conducted visually.
            We propose a quantitative method for DVH comparison based on historical data.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) The treatment of one prostate case was planned by seven planners, while imposing the same clinical objectives for PTV and OARs. <br>
            2) A deviation function L is proposed to measure the weighted area between the ideal and realized DVH.
            The weights are formed based on the distribution of past data of 100 comparable prostate cases.
            The frequencies were interpolated to form a continuous surface using tensor product piecewise cubic hermite interpolation.<br>
            3) The proposed method is universal and applies to other organs and/or combinations of criteria as well and clearly separated visually comparable plans, which was clinically verified.

                IMRT data of comparable treatments are statistically analyzed to identify clinical preferences and establish best practices for future decision‐making processes.
                Statistical measures are used for variations in the DVH of 100 head and neck cancer patients from IU‐Simon Cancer Center. All three measures show considerable variation amongst DVHs.  We also observe that standard statistical tools sensitive to data uncertainty.

                <b>Contributions:</b>
                1) Unanimous decisions for DVHs exist only at lower values of volume and dose.<br>
                2) Significant variations in the DVH falloff region: the increased variations in the steepness suggest that individual preferences are more divergent.<br>
                3) A closer unanimity in future decision‐making may lead to enhanced planner independence of IMRT treatments.

            Dosimetry is impacted by the calculational  grid size, which is studied for head and neck IMRT with special consideration on the tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), which were computed using LQ Poisson model and Lyman Kutcher Burman model respectively from DVH data.
            Five head and neck patients treated with IMRT and daily IGRT were chosen for this study.
            Treatment plans were generated for different grid sizes (1-5mm).  All other protocols remained the same.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) The PTV mean dose decreases with increasing grid size from 1mm to 5mm.<br>
            2) TCP decreases with increasing grid size. Mean dose and NTCP for the right parotid increases with increasing grid size. Similar patterns were observed for all other OARs: left parotid, mandible, brainstem and spinal cord. <br>
            3) Smallest possible grid size should be used for accurate dose calculation in head and neck IMRT planning. <br>
            4) Smallest calculational grid also improves TCP for target volumes and reduces NTCP for normal tissues.

        <div style="display:none" id="4d_opti_motion" ><b>Summary:</b>
            Motion uncertainties can substantially degrade the quality of an otherwise optimized treatment plan. We present a novel 4D‐optimization technique that exploits time effects and provides plans which are robust against tumor motion and warrant deliverability.
            The 4D‐optimization technique takes all registered breathing phases into account. All 4D CT data are conformally registered. To account for lung tissue inhomogeneities, we use Monte Carlo dose calculations.

            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) This is the first method to address fully 4D-robust approach.<br>
            2) A novel deliverability constraint insures closeness of the beamlet intensities for neighboring phases. <br>
            3) Based on a clinical lung cancer case, this method delivers robust plans that significantly outperform the gating‐based optimal plans both in terms of target coverage as well as OAR sparing.<br>
            4) The plan is also inherently robust against sequencing and delivery errors.

        <div style="display:none" id="4d_inverse" ><b>Summary:</b>
            Motion of the patient and inner organs does not substantially change the spatial dose distribution in photon therapy in the room coordinate system, aside from the build‐up region. In other words, organs move within a static “dose cloud”. Using this approximation it is easy to understand the consequences of motion: systematic errors (lack of accuracy) lead to an offset of the dose distribution in the frame of the organs, and random errors (lack of precision) lead to dose blurring.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Overview of concepts of motion blur and PDF.<br>
            2) De‐blurring a dose distribution through “4D” motion optimization is discussed.<br>
            3) The relative potential and limitations of 4D motion optimization is compared with margins and gating.

        <i>Robust Optimization for Lung Treatment in the Presence of Dosimetric Errors,</i>

        <div style="display:none" id="rob_lung_all" ><b>Summary:</b>
            Uncertainties, such as breathing motion, can substantially degrade the quality of an otherwise optimized treatment plan.
            The quality of robustly optimized plans significantly depend on how well the underlying dose calculation matches the actual delivered dose to the treated organ.
            We present two planning concepts using robust optimization techniques. The first concept relies on pencil beam based calculation of the delivered dose. The second method employs Monte Carlo dose calculation.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) The first robust optimization algorithm that provides optimized IMRT plans which are inherently robust against dosimetric errors.<br>
            2) We observe a significant laterally scattered dose that is not capture with simple pencil beam algorithms, amounting to up to 30%.<br>
            3) If the treated structure does not reveal significant inhomogeneities, using a computationally less expensive dose calculation can allow for more sophisticated types of treatment optimizations, e.g.,  beam‐angle optimization.
