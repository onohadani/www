        <div id="rob_pred"><b>Summary:</b>
            Spatiotemporal tumor changes reduce the effectiveness of fractionated radiation therapy. We study a robust predictive method that can support treatment planning when spatiotemporal changes occur with uncertain progression
            A multi-scenario multi-time method is developed that hedges amongst these scenarios and provides plans that are on average equally good to current practice and remain acceptable even in the worst case. Two clinical lung cancer cases serve as proof of concept.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: Experts’s knowledge is directly incorporated into adaptive planning in a robust fashion, i.e., diverging opinions are accounted for.<br>
            2) Method: Offers a unifying framework for conventional, adaptive, and robust adaptive planning.<br>
            3) Application: The incorporation of multiple time-resolved datasets shows significantly improved treatment goals for patients with spatiotemporal changes during radiotherapy.<br>
            4) Application: The progress of chemotherapy can be accounted for into the radiation planning process, resulting plans withstands uncertainties, even in worst-case scenarios.

        <i>Robust Maximum Likelihood Estimation
        </i><br>(with D. Bertsimas and A. Fertis)
        <br>submitted (2016).
        <br>&nbsp;

        <div id="rmle"><b>Summary:</b>
            In many applications, statistical estimators serve to derive conclusions from data, most prominently in finance, medical decision-making and clinical trials.
            However, the conclusions are typically dependent on uncertainties in the data.
            We use robust optimization principles to construct robust maximum likelihood estimators that are immune against data errors.
            Both types of input data errors are considered: a) adversarial type, modeled using the notion of uncertainty sets,
            and b) probabilistic type, modeled by distributions.
            The estimator performance is demonstrated on two applications.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: The first robust approach to maximum likelihood estimators for data uncertainty (as opposed to distributional uncertainty). Therefore, they allow practical interpretation.<br>
            2) Method: We provide efficient local and global search algorithms to compute the robust estimators and discuss them in detail for the case of multivariate normally distributed data.<br>
            3) Application: For simulated data, these estimators are robust against both types of uncertainty and provide significantly more accurate estimates, compared to classical estimators.<br>
            4) Application: We establish a range of uncertainty sizes, for which robust estimators are superior.<br>
            5) Application: In cancer radiation therapy, there are significant uncertainties amongst plans.
            Robust estimators offer more reliable decisions when applied to a large set of past treatment plans.

        <i>Robust Optimization with Time-Dependent Uncertainty in Radiation Therapy Planning
        </i><br>(with A. Roy)
        <br>submitted (2016).
        <br>&nbsp;
        <a onclick="toggle_visibility('time_dep');"><u>Details</u></a>
        <div id="time_dep"><b>Summary:</b>
            Recent approaches to multi-stage robust optimization assume fixed uncertainties.
            However, in many applications, uncertainties evolve over time, rendering the robust solutions suboptimal.
            This issue is particularly prevalent in medical decision-making, where a patient's condition can change during the course of the treatment.
            We provide a general robust optimization framework that incorporates time-dependent uncertainty sets in a tractable fashion.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: The temporal changes are modeled as conic robust two-stage linear problems for which we provide robust counterparts for uncertain constraint parameters.<br>
            2) Method: Robust solutions to temporally connected uncertainty sets are NP-hard.  In this context, this is a first tractable reformulation.<br>
            3) Application: In radiation therapy, changes in oxygenation affect the response to radiation.
            For clinical cases, our approach improves tumor control throughout the treatment, as opposed to current methods that lose efficacy at some stage.<br>
            4) Application: We also provide the  optimal observation timing that maximizes the value of information.
            These findings are general and can be applied to a broad range of applications, e.g., in maintenance scheduling.

        <i>Robust Optimization for Decision−Dependent Uncertainties

        <br>submitted (2015).
        <br>&nbsp;
        <a onclick="toggle_visibility('ddu');"><u>Details</u></a>
        <div id="ddu"><b>Summary:</b>
            The efficacy of robust optimization methods has recently been extended to multistage problems with uncertainties bound in predetermined sets.
            Although current frameworks are general, they cannot accurately describe problems in which uncertainties are affected by previous decisions.
            This paper takes a step toward generalizing robust optimization approaches to problems with decision-dependent uncertainties, which we show to be NP-complete.
            For this, we provide reformulations of robust optimization problems with uncertainty sets that are functions of decisions.
            To this end, we advance tractable programs for a broad range of objective function, constraint, and uncertainty set structures.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: This is the first robust optimization framework for decision-dependent uncertainties in a general setting.<br>
            2) Method: The provided reformulations can be solved with off-the-shelf algorithms.<br>
            3) Application: To illustrate the advantages of this framework, a facility location  and a shortest path problem are discussed, where the first-stage decisions affect the second-stage uncertainties.

            <div id="imrt_stats" ><b>Summary:</b> Robust statistical tools are developed to study correlations amongst radiation therapy evaluation criteria and how their relaxation impacts the overall plan.
                100 Head-and-neck cancer cases, that were planned using the same planning system and protocol, are analyzed for tumor volume, brainstem, and spinal cord.
                Despite the imposed institutional and international recommendations, significant variations amongst the criteria were identified. Even though these aims are evaluated independently, sizable negative correlations amongst them are possible, indicating that some goals cannot be satisfied concurrently.
                <br><br>
                <b>Contributions:</b> 1) Method: We develop a robust analytics method for radiation plan evaluation, where conclusions are not sensitive to sample size or variations within the set.<br>
                2) Application: This is the first analysis of a large set of clinical data that quantitatively reports negative correlations amongst planning goals, indicating that some goals cannot be satisfied concurrently, questioning established recommendations.

            <div id="nanohub"><b>Summary:</b> A framework for analysis of large-scale behavioral data is developed. Our objectives are (a) a computationally lean method to cope with large data sets and (b) to be free of assumptions of the structure of data. Three data-driven metrics are introduced based only on the size and volume of data, using nested arrangements of zero and infinity norms.
                We apply this method to analyze the behavior of users of nanoHUB services, the world’s largest cyber-infrastructure for nanotechnology research and education.
                The method clearly disperses two previously unknown categories of power and casual users.
                Moreover, new subcategories of classroom users are identified. These findings allow policy makers to optimally tailor educational programs to such uncoordinated groups.
                <br><br>
                <b>Contributions:</b> 1) Method: The unsupervised learning method is computationally attractive for large data sets and does not require specific data structure.<br>
                2) Application: Given nanoHUB’s size, its leading role in educational services, and the approach’s data-driven nature, this method is applicable to a wide range of cloud services.<br>
                3) Application: This method is actually implemented on the realtime data base and serves to report and customize services.

        <a onclick="toggle_visibility('bao');"><u>Details</u></a>
        <div id="bao"><b>Summary:</b> In radiation therapy planning, there are two key decisions: selection of beam angles and optimal beam intensities.
            Often, these two decisions are made separately, even though they are mutually dependent.
            We develop an algorithm which automatically selects the beam angles and computes the beam intensities. Since the size of this problem is computationally intractable for clinical cases, we propose a hybrid method, which combines a simulated annealing procedure of Bertsimas and Nohadani (2010) with the knowledge of the gradient. Gradient information is used to quickly find a local minimum, while simulated annealing allows to search for global minima.
            The beam intensities are optimized by solving a Linear Programming model.
            Experimental results are performed on phantom and real-life case studies, showing the advantages that come from our approach.
            <br><br>
            <b>Contributions:</b>
            1) Method: Previous approaches are computationally not tractable, while this method performs for clinical cases in practical times.<br>
            2) Application: While the clinical practice relies on expert’s decision on “good’’ beam angle, this method offers optimal solutions.<br>
            3) Application: Previous work required a set of candidate angles, whereas this method optimized over the entire range. Indeed, it dynamically explores angles and discretizes to the maximum accuracy of the linear accelerator machine.<br>

    <div id="rsa"><b>Summary:</b>
        A robust simulated annealing algorithm is introduced that does not require any knowledge of the problems structure.
        While this nonconvex and global optimization method improves the performance as well as the robustness, it also warrants for a global optimum which is robust against data and implementation uncertainties.
        <br><br>
        <b>Contributions:</b>
        1) Method: This is the first robust global optimization algorithm for arbitrary objective functions.<br>
        2) Method: A new measure of robustness is introduced that accounts for both local and neighborhood sensitivity.<br>
        3) Application: In many engineering applications, solutions are not explicitly known, hence require optimization methods that are independent of the function structure.<br>
        4) Application: For a high-dimensional nanophotonic problem, this method shows significant improvements in efficiency as well as in actual optimality.

    <div id="rls"><b>Summary:</b>
        Although the theory of robust convex optimization has taken significant strides over the past decade, all approaches fail if the underlying cost function is not explicitly given; it is even worse if the cost function is nonconvex. In this work, we present a robust optimization method for unconstrained problems with a nonconvex cost function as well as for problems based on simulations, such as large partial differential equations solver, response surface, and Kriging metamodels. This technique can be employed for most real-world problems.
        <br><br>
        <b>Contributions:</b>
        1) Method: This is the first nonconvex robust optimization approach, which has been applied to many real-world problems by us and many others.<br>
        2) Method: The generalization addresses nonconvex optimization problems under both implementation errors and parameter uncertainties.<br>
        3) Application: In an electromagnetic multiple scattering problem of aperiodically arranged dielectrics, relevant to nanophotonic design, our robust solution significantly lowered the worst-case cost, while maintaining optimality.

    <div id="dose"><b>Summary:</b>
        All radiation therapy planning relies on accurate dose calculation.
        A robust optimization method is introduced which handles dosimetric errors and warrants for high-quality IMRT plans. Unlike other dose error estimations, we do not rely on the detailed knowledge about the sources of the uncertainty and use a generic error model. We demonstrate the method on a clinical case of lung cancer.
        <br><br>
        <b>Contributions:</b>
        1) Method: The generic error models allows to cope with a large variety of error sources.<br>
        2) Method: The method merges the higher efficiency of low-accuracy dose calculation approaches with the high-accuracy of computationally intractable Monte-Carlo dose calculations.<br>
        3) Application: The resulting plans are more robust against dosimetric errors and are clinically acceptable.<br>
        4) Application: The achieved speedup will allow computationally extensive multi-criteria or beam-angle optimization approaches to warrant for dosimetrically relevant plans.

    <div id="goto"><b>Summary:</b>
        Often, the physical properties of a system can only be described by numerical simulation. Optimization of such systems is usually accomplished heuristically without taking errors into account.
        We present a robust optimization method for electromagnetic scattering problems with large degrees of freedom and report on results when this technique is applied to optimization of aperiodic dielectric structures.
        <br><br>
        <b>Contributions:</b>
        1) Method: For the nominal problem, 2 methods are developed i) a gradient-free stochastic algorithm based on the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation  (SPSA); and ii) a modified gradient descent algorithm based on solving an adjoint linear system.<br>
        2) Method: For the robust problem, a local search algorithm is developed.<br>
        3) Application: Based on a two-dimensional Helmholtz equation for lossless dielectric scatterers, hence scales with frequency and is  relevant to nanophotonics.<br>
        4) Application: The spatial configuration of 50 dielectric scatterers is robustly optimized, showing improved robustness to prototyping and manufacturing errors.

    <div id="die"><b>Summary:</b>
        For the design of nanoscale dielectric structures for photonic applications,
        two complementary algorithms are introduced.
        The first approach uses adaptive local random updates and progressively adjusts individual dielectric layer widths.
        The second approach is based on global updating functions in which large subgroups of layers are adjusted simultaneously.
        Both schemes are applied to obtain specific target responses of the transmission function within selected energy windows.
        <!--, such as discontinuous cutoff or power-law decay filters close to a photonic band edge. -->
        <br><br>
        <b>Contributions:</b>
        1) Method: The local approach relies on an annealing process with constraints and is improved using Metropolis criterion.<br>
        2) Method: The global approach is based on an analytical expansion of the strength function, fixing the leading order expansion coefficients by boundary conditions, and adjusting the remaining ones by numerical optimization.<br>
        3) Application: Intentionally breaking translational symmetry leads to improved functionality.<br>
        4) Application: These algorithms are effective tools in the custom design of nanoscale photonic  structures.
