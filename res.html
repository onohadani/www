<!--Using optimization methods can bring forth additional functionalities which are not possible with conventional methods. -->
<!-- In principle, an optimized solution may perform suboptimaly when errors in implementation or model parameters are encountered.
I focus my research on the real-world applicability of the solutions.

The goal of my research is to robustly solve and optimize problems in environments affected by errors in implementation, in modeling, and in parameter specification amongst others.
This is important because quite often, if such errors are not taken into account in the design process, the entire phenomenon that the design aspires to exploit might disappear all together.
The reason that this is challenging is that a) often the description of the objective function and the constraints are given by simulation (e.g. solving appropriate partial differential equations) that is not known in analytically closed form, and b) the underlying functions are highly nonconvex.

Optimization in its broad definition and robust optimization, in particular, are my core research areas. My goal is to develop methods in nonconvex, in multi-objective, and in multi-stage settings because they directly relate to real-world problems, e.g., machine learning, healthcare, supply chain, and engineering design.
